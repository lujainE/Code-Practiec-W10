								<p>Soad Hosny was married four times. Around 1968, she was married to cinematographer Salah Kurayyem; the marriage lasted for approximately one year. In 1970, Hosny was married to the Egyptian film director Ali Badrakhan; this marriage lasted for approximately eleven years. She was then married to Zaki Fatin Abdel Wahab, son of Fateen Abdel Wahab and Leila Mourad in 1981. This marriage lasted only five months.[citation needed] Persistent rumours claim that her first marriage was to the actor and singer, Abdel Halim Hafez (1929-1977), popularly known as "al Andaleeb al Asmar" [the tan nightingale], whom she is believed to have married in secret. However, her family have denied the veracity of such rumours. 
									She was romantically linked with various celebrities including the Egyptian film star, Abdel Halim Hafez. Despite never wearing a wedding dress in all her marriages, Hosni wore the wedding dress many times on screen through her films, and her first film husband was the Egyptian film star Salah Zulfikar in Money and Women of 1960. The rumor of her marriage to Abdel Halim Hafez was not the first in her life. In late 1962, a strong rumor spread in the Egyptian press about her marriage to Salah Zulfikar who’s one of his country's most iconic male performers of all time and was popularly known as "Fares al Ahlem" [the Knight of the dreams], while filming with Zulfikar in Appointment at the Tower. Filming of the film scenes began in the Cairo Tower, and the team continued for two weeks on board the ship Aida in the Mediterranean, and after filming ended, the rumor of her marriage to Salah Zulfikar spread in newspapers and magazines at the time. Zulfikar did not forget the nature of his previous work as a police officer and began with his sense of security to investigate the source of the rumor, to make sure that the lighting worker in the film crew was the owner of the rumor after a kiss was filmed between Zulfikar and Soad Hosny, where the kiss lasted for three minutes, until Zulfikar sensed it took them too long and told the cinematographer, "Stop", and so the worker built this rumor because of the shot, but this rumor was denied and later, the two film stars participated in more than one film together. Her fourth and final marriage was to screen writer Maher Awad.

						      <p>At the age of three, she began her career when she sang in the popular Egyptian children's TV program, Papa Sharo, a popular program hosted by prominent kids' shows presenter Mohamed Shaaban. Her work included a wide range of genres – from light comedies and romances through to political satire. Her film debut was in Hassan and Nayima (1959). She is credited with acting in films with the most notable Egyptian film stars such as Omar Sharif, Salah Zulfikar and Rushdy Abaza. Her most well-known role was that of a college student who fell in love with her professor in the film, Hassan El Imam’s Watch Out for ZouZou (1972).

								Other important film credits include her roles in Hassan Al-Imam's Money and Women (1960) opposite Salah Zulfikar who she starred alongside as well in the commercial hit; Appointment at the Tower (1962) of Ezz El-Dine Zulficar. In the year 1964, she starred alongside Nadia Lutfi in Mahmoud Zulfikar's For Men Only, the film was a box office hit where she played a role of a girl disguised in a man's appearance to have the opportunity to work in a gas project. Hosny starred in Too Young for Love (1966) opposite Rushdy Abaza.
								In 1970, she starred alongside Salah Zulfikar and Rushdy Abaza in the political film; Sunset and Sunrise (1970) of Kamal El Sheikh. She worked in two films with Youssef Chahine during her career starting with The Choice (1970), and for the fourth time pairing with Salah Zulfikar in Those People of the Nile (1972). In 1974, she starred in Kamal El Sheikh's Whom Should We Shoot? (1974) alongside Mahmoud Yassin. Her next role was a student and political activist, who was tortured in Karnak (1975), the film was based on the novel by Naguib Mahfouz. In the film, Shafika and Metwali (1979) with Ahmed Zaki and People on the Top (1981) with Nour El-Sherif, she transformed the musical numbers into scathing satires which gave voice to the oppressed. For this and her other hard-hitting, politically relevant roles, she was seen as part of the intelligentsia.
								During her lifetime, she was known as the "Cinderella of the screen". She starred in films of every important Egyptian director during the 60s and 70s and played women in complex plots. In her later career, she played women who had been abused or victimised. Due to illness, she retired from acting in the 1991. Hosny's final screen appearance was in The Shepherd and the Women.</p>
